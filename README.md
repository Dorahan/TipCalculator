# Tip Calculator
<i>CodePath Assignment</i>

This is my first try coding an iOS application. I created it to complete the CodePath assignment.

Time spent: 3 hours in total

Completed user stories:

 - User can type the amount of bill and pick the percentage of tip to calculate the total amount.
 - User can divide the bill between people. The application allows division up to 5 people.
 
 
Notes:

First created the application following the tutorial video. Later redesigned my version on Sketch and tried to create the same application with my visuals. Also added a "Per person" value to show how to divide the bill between people. I ran into multiple problems as I was trying to recreate my version and had to scale down after not being able to find a solution by myself.
